   lazy(), but surviving a deployment.

   THE FAILURE THIS FIXES

   Every route in this app is a separate chunk, fetched the first time you
   navigate to it. The filename of each chunk contains a content hash, and
   the list of those filenames lives in the index.html the browser loaded.

   When a new version is deployed, every chunk gets a new hash and the old
   files stop being served. A browser that loaded index.html BEFORE the
   deploy is still holding the old list. The moment the person navigates to
   a page they have not visited yet, it requests a chunk that no longer
   exists, the dynamic import rejects, and React unmounts to the error
   boundary — "Something went wrong".

   The symptom is unmistakable: it happens once, on a page that worked
   yesterday, and reloading fixes it permanently. Reloading works because it
   fetches the new index.html with the new chunk names.

   THE FIX

   Catch that specific rejection and reload once. The reload is the same
   action the person would take, done before they see a crash screen.

   The one-shot guard matters. If the chunk is missing for any OTHER reason
   — they are offline, or a file genuinely failed to deploy — reloading
   again would produce an infinite refresh loop, which is a far worse
   experience than an error screen. So a marker is written to
   sessionStorage first: the first failure reloads, a second failure in the
   same tab gives up and lets the error boundary show. The marker clears on
   the next successful import, so the next deployment recovers too.

   PRELOADING (performance)

   React 19 keeps a Suspense fallback on screen for at least ~300 ms once it
   has been shown. Every page here is a lazy chunk, so the first visit to a
   page (the dashboard right after login, the list a dashboard figure drills
   into) showed "Loading…" and then waited out that 300 ms even when the
   chunk itself arrived in a few milliseconds.

   `Component.preload()` downloads the chunk ahead of time. When React later
   renders a page whose chunk is already loaded, the factory hands back an
   already-settled thenable, React resolves the lazy component synchronously
   and never shows the fallback — so there is no 300 ms wait at all.

   A failed preload is ignored on purpose: it must never reload the page
   under someone who is working. The real navigation still goes through the
   recovery path above.
